This code snippet is used to generate a QR code that, when scanned, directs the user to the URL "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org". Below is a brief README explaining the code:

QR Code Generator

This Python script generates a QR code for a specified URL using the qrcode library.

Requirements
  
  Python 3.x
  qrcode library
  Pillow (Python Imaging Library, often installed as Pillow)

Installation
  To install the required libraries, use the following pip commands:
  pip install qrcode[pil]
  pip install pillow

Usage
  The script includes the following key steps:
  Import Libraries:
  import qrcode
  import image

Create a QRCode Object:

  The QRCode object is initialized with the following parameters:
  version=15: Controls the size of the QR code (higher numbers result in larger codes with more data capacity).
  box_size=10: Sets the size of each box in the QR code.
  border=5: Sets the thickness of the border (in boxes).
  qr = qrcode.QRCode(
      version=15,
      box_size=10,
      border=5
  )

Add Data to the QR Code:
  
  The URL "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org" is added to the QR code.
  data = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org"
  qr.add_data(data)
  qr.make(fit=True)

Generate the QR Code Image:

  The make_image method is used to generate the QR code image with the specified fill (foreground) and back_color (background) colors.
  img = qr.make_image(fill="black", back_color="white")

Save the QR Code Image:

  The generated QR code image is saved to a file named "test.png".
  img.save("test.png")

Output
  
  The script generates a QR code image saved as "test.png". Scanning this QR code with a QR code reader will direct the user to "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org".
